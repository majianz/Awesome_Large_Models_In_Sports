## ðŸ”” News
-   **[2025-10]** We have released ["A Survey of Large Models in Sports"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23918), a **comprehensive survey** dedicated to the emerging application of Large Models (LMs) in sports. 
-   **[2025-10]** We created this repository to maintain a paper list on Awesome-Large-Models-In-Sports. Contributions are welcome!

## Introduction

Welcome to **Awesome-Large-Models-In-Sports** ðŸ‘‹  
Sports have witnessed a surge of global enthusiasm, becoming a driving force for physical health, social connection, and cultural exchange. With the rapid rise of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**, **Large Models (LMs)** is transforming how we understand, analyze, and interact with sports. This repository is the **first comprehensive survey and curated collection** that systematically explores the intersection of **Large Models and sports**.

We organize the applications into **six major stakeholder groups**, as shown in the figure below:

1. **Athletes & Trainers** â€“ exercise and training plans, injury prevention, rehabilitation, and sports psychology  
2. **Coaches & Educators** â€“ action recognition, performance prediction, and tactics or strategies  
3. **Referees** â€“ decision support, fairness, and explainable refereeing systems  
4. **Fans & Media** â€“ commentary, highlights, storytelling, news, sentiment analysis and general sports models
5. **Researchers** â€“ academic writing and knowledge discovery in sports science  
6. **The Sports Industry** â€“ management, talent scouting, and tourism applications  

<p align="center">
  <img src="applications.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Overview of Large Models in Sports" width="80%">
</p>

We further structure the repository following the **taxonomy tree** introduced in our paper, offering a clear overview of research topics, tasks, and datasets within each stakeholder group.

<p align="center">
  <img src="taxonomy.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Taxonomy of Large Models in Sports" width="80%">
</p>

This collection serves as an open, evolving resource for **researchers, developers, and sports enthusiasts** eager to explore the forefront of AI in sports â€” and to discover what large models can bring to the next generation of **sports intelligence**.
